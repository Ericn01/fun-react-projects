# Dynamic Resume Builder

Here we go, another fun challenge project with React, this time using Typescript for strong(er) typing, and tailwindcss for all the wonderful utility CSS classes they provide.

## Project Goals

Users will add information that is typically found in a resume, and will view a live preview of their resume as they go about filling it. The live preview will be an HTML version, based off a template. I could add more templates later on to have more customizability.
